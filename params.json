Different views of the model-data (like XML, HTML5, ...) are possible by duplicating and adapting the view-components. The provided view-components are based on the HTML4.01 specification.\r\n\r\nPlease note that only a (very) basic set of view-components are provided. The framework can be used as model/design/start for creating an experimental web-app, but, is not sufficient to create a full-blown web-app. Basic functionality is demonstrated as a temperature conversion web-app.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
