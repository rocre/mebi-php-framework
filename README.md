# mebi-php-framework

Very basic PHP framework, based on MVC.

Designed with MVC-principles in mind, this framework provides some basic functions like webrouting and view-components.

The framework delegates the creation/generation of HTML-code entirely to the view-components. Different views of the model-data (like XML, HTML5, ...) are possible by duplicating and adapting the view-components. The provided view-components are based on the HTML4.01 specification.

Please note that only a (very) basic set of view-components are provided. The framework can be used as model/design/start for creating an experimental web-app, but, is not sufficient to create a full-blown web-app. Basic functionality is demonstrated as a temperature conversion web-app.
